(wip) better inventory manager for valorant, kinda like destiny item manager but not really

# Installation/Usage
<!-- **[Demo/tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scMHkcre9yE) â†’ urnotjustin's Youtube video** -->

### 1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/colinhartigan/valorant-inventory-manager/releases/latest) (executable)
It is recommended that you use the [latest release](https://github.com/colinhartigan/valorant-inventory-manager/releases/latest) as compatibility is continuously phased out for old versions as development continues.

### 2. Run VIM.exe
As long as `VIM.exe` is running, the randomizer/other features will remain running. **The website does not always need to be open for VIM to work.** Since VIM is packaged into a single file and requires no installer, it is recommended that you move the executable from the downloads folder to a more accessible location, like your taskbar or desktop.

### 3. Open the web client
Open https://colinhartigan.github.io/valorant-inventory-manager/ to interact with VIM! You can set favorite skins, manage the randomizer, and change other settings from there.

## Building the server from source
> Understandably, some people may want to build the client companion (server) on their own machine due to concerns about the unsigned executable... if you know a way around this or a potential way around the false-positive AV detections please reach out on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/uGuswsZwAT).

### 1. Clone the repository
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/colinhartigan/valorant-inventory-manager.git
```
The `client/` directory is not used, so feel free to delete it.

### 2. Install Python packages
```cmd
cd server
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2.1. (optional) Modify client config debug settings
In `/server/src/client_config.py`, feel free to mess with the debug settings.

**UNLOCK_ALL_SKINS** can be enabled to make it appear as if you own all the skins, but equipping them doesn't actually do anything.

### 3. Build the server executable
```cmd
cd server
./build.bat
```
The executable will be dumped to `dist/`. 

# Features
### Completed
- better inventory UI/UX than VALORANT's native system
- skin favorites, post-match randomizer
- buddy searching, favoriting, randomizing
- loadout profiles with favorite skins per profile

### Planned
- favorite skin/buddy combos
